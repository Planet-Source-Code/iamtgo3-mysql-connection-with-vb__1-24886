Project Name: mySQL Connection with VB

Description:
This program requires that you have mySQL loaded somewhere you can connect to it.
You must also have myODBC loaded on your machine. This program uses Windows ODBC
to connect to your mySQL database. I just put a bunch of controls on a form to play
around with it and thought others might be interested in looking at it. Basically 
it allows you to connect to a mySQL database and ADD, EDIT, and DELETE records.
